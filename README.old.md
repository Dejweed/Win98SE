# SE98 Icon theme
### This is an icon pack inspired by [Chicago95 theme](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/tree/master/Icons "github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/tree/master/Icons") (actually it's a fork) of [Grassmunk](https://github.com/grassmunk "github.com/grassmunk") with icons in Windows 98 SE style.

- Added some 48x48, 24x24, 22x22 and 64x64 sizes of 256 color palette.
