# Please donate a small money for poor Ukrainian woman.

If you want to support me, you can't do that because I live in Russia ![](ru.png) and our banks are banned for US, EU and some other countries.
But you, however, can help Anna Kovach, a poor and sick woman I know in Ukraine ![](ua.png) with some money.

She has a heart disease and diabetes, she lives in the city of Rakhiv, Transcarpathian region of Ukraine (West). Her disability pension is about $100 per month. This money is not enough for food and medicine, and Ukraine today is not such a rich country to provide sufficient financial assistance to the disabled.

If you are ready to help, [send me an email](mailto:voltasar@gmail.com), and I will give you her card number and phone number for communication (she understands only Russian and Ukrainian).
